# Data Management Case Study

This project analyses the case of Sophie, a tourism student conducting research on the proliferation of tourist apartments in a historic coastal neighbourhood. It focuses on the collection, classification, and management of data from multiple public and private sources, including government open data portals, utility companies, and transport providers. The study explores open data standards, data quality classification, and privacy considerations in handling sensitive information. Objectives include understanding how effective data management supports research reliability, transparency, and informed urban planning decisions. Overall, the project highlights the importance of data governance and ethical practices in academic and professional data-driven research.

## Sophie's Case: Backgorund
Sophie is a university student in her final year of a Bachelor's degree in Tourism. She has to complete her Final Degree Project on the proliferation of tourist apartments in a historic neighborhood of a coastal city. Sophie is 700 km away from the coastal city and, to gather information, she must rely on data available on the internet from governmental entities, public organizations, and private companies. Additionally, she verifies this data through phone calls or virtual meetings with the managers.
 
She begins to gather information and discovers that many organizations have an online space called Open Data where they publish reports, statistics, and data on various subjects. On the website of the local city council, she finds a wealth of important information.
 
There are PDF files that include statistics on the population census evolution over the last 10 years, sorted by neighborhoods and by age group. Additionally, images of urban space constructions and modifications are also included. From the municipal water company, she gathers information on the average water consumption by neighborhood in the city over the last decade. The electric supply is managed by private companies, though there is also a municipal electric company that has all its consumption and management data on the web; however, access to private companies' data requires client passwords.
 
Therefore, Sophie decides to contact some residents of the area and manages to have them send photos of their recent bills. Another line of research involves the type and frequency of transport options that connect the city with the country's major capitals. Through an API, she obtains data provided by AMTRAK, American Airlines, and AirEuropa. This data, regarding schedules, frequencies, and number of passengers, is tabulated in CSV files.
 
Finding little information about rental cars, she decides to get in touch with the main companies. Some of them email her the requested information. Finally, she visits the website of a well-known vacation rental company where there is a lot of information about accommodations in the study area and links these data not only with accommodations but also with other services that clients purchase such as transport, insurance, travel guides, excursions, etc.
 
All this makes Sophie very happy as she has been able to gather extensive documentation to complete her Final Degree Project and obtain her degree without leaving her living room.

## To do:

1. Question:

Sophie has gathered information from various entities and companies, both public and private, including the city council, urban planning department, municipal water company, municipal electric company, private electric companies, transportation companies, individuals, and a vacation service company. Do you think all these data can be considered Open Data? Which ones not?
 
2. Question:

The quality of open data is determined by a star classification based on the type, format, and relationships of the data. What category would the data offered by the city council and urban planning department fall into?

3. Question:
   
What classification would the data provided by AMTRAK and the airline companies have? What actions should be taken to upgrade their category?

4. Question:
   
The data provided by the vacation service company is classified as 4-stars. Why? What would need to happen for it to be rated 5-stars?
 
5. Question:

For the data Sophie collects from individual clients, what data security and privacy measures should she implement?
 
6. Question:

Do you think Sophie needs to check any other data for her work to be reliable and to ensure the area does not become overly saturated with tourists (if it isnâ€™t already)?
 
7. Question:

A consultancy discovers that there are many similar tourist impact studies across the country. It decides to contact all the authors of these studies to collect their data and establish connections when making decisions on new urban planning actions. This consultancy advises urban development companies on the best locations to establish in the country. Would the decisions made by the consultancy based on these studies be classified as Data Management decisions? What category would the data acquired by this consultancy fall into once it becomes their data?
